// Prefix and postfix

let a = 20;
let b = a++; //As we are using the increment operator in postfix that's why the first 20 is assigned to b and then the value of a is incremented to ++ ie. 21
console.log(`a:${a}, b:${b}`);

console.log();
console.log();

let y = 40;
let z = ++y;
console.log(`y:${y}, z:${z}`);
